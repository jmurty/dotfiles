=============================
Mutable History For Mercurial
=============================

This package supplies the ``evolve`` extension for Mercurial, which
provides several commands to mutate history and deal with the
resulting issues.

It also:

    - enables the "changeset obsolescence" feature of Mercurial
    - issues several warning messages when trouble appears in your repository

**This extension is experimental and not yet meant for production.**

You can enable it by adding the line below to the ``extensions``
section of your hgrc::

    evolve = PATH/TO/mutable-history/hgext/evolve.py

We recommend reading the documentation first. An online version is
available here:

    http://hg-lab.logilab.org/doc/mutable-history/html/

Or see the ``doc/`` directory for a local copy.

Contribute
==========

The simplest way to contribute is to issue a pull request on Bitbucket
(https://bitbucket.org/marmoute/mutable-history). Please don't forget
to update and run the tests when you fix a bug or add a feature. To
run the tests:

    cd tests
    python run-tests.py --with-hg=/path/to/hg

However, some cutting-edge changes may be found in a mutable repository hosted
by logilab before they are published.

Be sure to check latest draft changeset before submitting new changesets.
